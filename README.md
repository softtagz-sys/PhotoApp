# PhotoApp: Xamarin Party and Event Photo App

## Project Overview

PhotoApp is a Xamarin-based mobile application developed as part of our General Integrated Project (GIP) during our 6th year at Sint Cordula in Schoten. The app was created in collaboration with SDM2003 and is designed to enhance parties, weddings, and other events by allowing attendees to collectively capture and share photos. The captured photos are stored on a central FTP server, creating a fun and memorable photo book for all guests at the end of the event.

## Features

- **Event Creation:** Users can create events for parties, weddings, and other gatherings.
- **Attendee Login:** Event attendees can log in to the event using a unique code.
- **Photo Capture:** Attendees can take photos within the app.
- **Central Storage:** All photos are uploaded and stored on a central FTP server.
- **Shared Photo Album:** At the end of the event, all photos are compiled into a shared photo album accessible to all attendees.

## Learning Experience

Developing PhotoApp was a challenging but rewarding project. We gained significant experience in the following areas:

- **Mobile App Development:** Utilizing Xamarin for cross-platform app development.
- **User Authentication:** Implementing a secure login system for event attendees.
- **Photo Handling:** Capturing and uploading photos efficiently.
- **FTP Integration:** Storing and managing files on a central FTP server.
- **Collaboration:** Working effectively as a team to bring the project to completion.

## Technologies Used

- **Xamarin:** For cross-platform mobile application development.
- **C#:** As the primary programming language.
- **FTP Server:** For centralized photo storage.
- **Visual Studio:** As the integrated development environment (IDE).
